# UFO Sightings

## Overview
In this project, we use Javascript to add interactivity to website- allowing users to filter data on UFO sightings based on their own input.

## Results

![Home Page] (homepage.png)

The homepage displays as this. 

![Search Results] (search_results.png)

To filter your search, you would enter an input(s) into either fields. For example, if I am interested in UFO sightings on 1/11/2010 and in Florida, I'd enter '1/11/2010' in Date field and 'fl' in State field.

## Summary
A drawback of the webpage is that it has little flexibility in input choice, largely due to small dataset we are using. It would be better to use a dropdown menu for user to select what the are interested in instead of typing it out, to avoid any input errors. If we would like to keep this kind of input, additional code should be writtent to catch and fix errors. i.e. through if-else statements and displaying a message to user. A table key of possible entries would be helpful as well instead of looking through entire chart.
